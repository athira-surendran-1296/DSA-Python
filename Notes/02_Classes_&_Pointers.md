# Why is a class used in python?
- Usually classes are used to define a data type
- Python has build in classes like Integer, String etc
- __init__ --> is the constructor of the class, first argument is self(this), rest of the paraments are values we need to pass to the class for initialisation
- Class can have its own menthods
- All the methods in the class take self as its first argument
